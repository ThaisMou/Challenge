Hello, Welcome!

I would like to say thank you for oppurtunity to challenge my some to create and learning something new.

In this Folder you will find more 5 others folders:
 - The folders 'Session1F and Session1S' refers to the Programming Logic challenge:
  *Session1F - It means "Session 1 First" that refers to [#1] Step one.
  *Session2S - It means "Session 1 Second" that refers to [#2] Step two.
 - The Folder 'Session2' refers to Test Automation challenge.
[ About this one i have to say that i could not run the test because i had problems with VS code and  Visual Studio. I think that some package is missing but i could not indentify which.]

 - And the folders incide Session3 folder is an attempt to complet the last challenge that i really could not. I have never even think about to creat an API so that was a new universe for me that i like to discover more. But with the time i have and knowledgement i have now it was not possible complete. The codes and tries are in there just to your information about my 'way to thinking' that possibly works. 

If you have any questions, you can ask me.
